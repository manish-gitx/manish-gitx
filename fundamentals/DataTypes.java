        system.out.println(a) // the variable should be assigned in previous lines before using it
        int Var;
        int var; BOTH are different cuz of caps in first letter
        1)the variable name should not start with numericals and cant have special characters expect underscore
        THE best way to assign a variable name is using small letters for first word and continue with capital
        of first character and then small worlds ex:isPrime this way is called camelCase
